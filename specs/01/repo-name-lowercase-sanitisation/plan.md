# Plan: Repo Name Lowercase Sanitisation

1. Identify the sanitisation logic for repo owner and repo name.
2. Update the logic to convert both to lowercase.
3. Add/modify a test to confirm correct behaviour for mixed-case inputs.
4. Commit spec and plan files.
5. Implement code changes.
6. Run CI to validate.
7. Commit code and test changes if CI passes.
