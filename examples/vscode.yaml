# VS Code Dev Container Example
#
# This configuration is optimized for use with VS Code's Remote - Containers
# extension via the rockervsc command or 'rockerc --vsc'.
#
# Usage:
#   rockerc --vsc        # Launch container and attach VS Code
#   rockervsc            # Alias for the above command
#
# The container is always run in detached mode with a standardized workspace
# mount at /workspaces/<container-name>. VS Code attaches to this running
# container for a seamless development experience.

# Extensions for VS Code development
args:
  - x11             # X11 support (for GUI debugging tools)
  - user            # User matching for correct file permissions
  - pull            # Ensure latest image
  - git             # Git integration
  - pixi            # Modern package management
  - uv              # Fast Python package installer
  - deps            # System dependencies
  - dev-helpers     # Development utilities

# Optional: Pre-configure container name for consistency
# name: my-vscode-project

# The --vsc flag automatically:
# 1. Ensures container runs detached with proper workspace mount
# 2. Launches VS Code attached to the container
# 3. Opens an interactive shell in the container
# 4. Reuses existing container if it's already running
#
# Use --force to recreate the container:
#   rockerc --vsc --force
