# Dockerfile-based rockerc.yaml Example
#
# Instead of using a pre-built image, you can specify a Dockerfile to build.
# rockerc will build the image and tag it automatically based on your
# project directory name.
#
# Note: When using dockerfile, the 'pull' extension is automatically removed
# since you're building locally.
#
# The dockerfile path is relative to the location of rockerc.yaml

# Path to Dockerfile (relative to this rockerc.yaml)
dockerfile: ./Dockerfile

# Extensions to apply to the built image
args:
  # Core extensions (pull will be auto-removed when using dockerfile)
  - pull            # Will be automatically removed for local builds
  - persist-image   # Keep the image after container stops
  - x11             # X11 forwarding
  - user            # User matching
  - cwd             # Mount working directory
  - git             # Git integration
  - git-clone       # Clone repositories with proper credentials
  - ssh             # SSH server integration
  - ssh-client      # SSH client with host key forwarding

  # Additional extensions
  - nvidia          # GPU support (if your Dockerfile supports it)

# Example Dockerfile content you might use:
# ---
# FROM ubuntu:24.04
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
#     python3 \
#     python3-pip \
#     build-essential
