# Global rockerc Configuration Example
#
# Save this as ~/.rockerc.yaml to set system-wide defaults
# that apply to all projects unless overridden.
#
# Project-specific rockerc.yaml files will:
# - Merge their 'args' list with these global args (duplicates removed)
# - Override other fields like 'image', 'name', 'volume', etc.
# - Can blacklist global extensions using 'extension-blacklist'
#
# This is useful for:
# - Setting up common development tools across all projects
# - Configuring user preferences (git, ssh, etc.)
# - Defining standard GPU or display settings

# No image specified here - projects will provide their own
# Or you can set a default:
# image: ubuntu:24.04

# Global extensions applied to all containers
args:
  # Core extensions - applied to all projects
  - pull            # Always pull latest images
  - persist-image   # Keep images after container stops
  - x11             # Always enable X11 for GUI apps
  - user            # Always match host user
  - cwd             # Mount working directory
  - git             # Use the global Git settings from the host
  - git-clone       # Install git, git-lfs, and ca-certificates for cloning
  - ssh             # Forward SSH agent into the container
  - ssh-client      # Install openssh-client and mount ~/.ssh directory

  # Additional global extensions (customize as needed)
  - dev-helpers     # Development tools in all containers
  - cuda            # GPU support (if you have NVIDIA GPU)

# You can also set global volumes
# volume: ~/.config:/home/user/.config:ro
