This project uses pixi to manage its environment.

look at the pyproject.toml to see the pixi tasks

Every time you make a change run `pixi r ci` to validate it works


Every time I give instructions add them to a 01-spec-name.md in the specs folder.  The first instruction should create the spec file and following instructions should be used to clarify the original spec. each time the spec file is updated commit just that file so that the history of the spec is maintained.
